# ToweringHeights
 First Unity game, mixed FPS and Tower Defence.
Started as a project to learn Unity and continue learning C# and object oriented programming.

The aim of this game is to create a tower defense game in which the environment towers above the player.
The gameplay would take place down in the 'valleys' where enemies spawn, while you construct towering defenses on the cliffsides around you.

The player will be able to move about the environment dynamically, and in a engaging manner (think grapples, wall jumps) to get up above the combat.

Each round takes places in FPS mode, while in between waves, an aerial view allows you to build and rotate the map.

A great deal of work was lost when my laptop was stolen, and being new to version control I had neglected to back this up.
I may return to it one day.
